🗓️ Dynamic User Availability & Event Scheduling System
Welcome to the Dynamic User Availability & Event Scheduling System—an intuitive and powerful tool designed to streamline scheduling for both users and administrators. Our system empowers users to effortlessly manage their availability, while providing administrators with the tools they need to schedule sessions without the headache of conflicting appointments.

🚀 Features
1. Dynamic User Availability Input
Seamless Availability Management: Users can log in and easily input their availability for specific days or the entire week. Flexibility is key—availability can be set for intervals as short as 30 minutes.
Detailed Scheduling: Specify start and end times for availability, accommodating varying schedules. Whether it's a full day of availability or just a few hours, users have complete control.
CRUD Operations: Users can add, update, or delete availability slots as needed, ensuring their schedules are always up-to-date.
2. Admin Scheduling Interface
Comprehensive Availability View: Administrators have access to a dashboard that displays user availability on a day-by-day basis. This makes it simple to find the perfect time slot for scheduling.
Smart Session Scheduling: Admins can select a user's availability and schedule sessions without conflicts. The system automatically checks for conflicts and prevents overlapping sessions.
Flexible Session Types: Choose between one-on-one or group sessions, with the ability to specify multiple participants. Scheduling has never been this flexible.
3. Session Management
Overview of Scheduled Sessions: Both users and admins can view all upcoming sessions, complete with details like participants, time, and duration.
Modifications & Notifications [BONUS]: Admins can reschedule or cancel sessions, with participants being notified of any changes. Users can also set their notification preferences (e.g., email, SMS).
4. Creative UI/UX Design
Intuitive & User-Friendly Interface: Our design prioritizes ease of use, with a clean and straightforward interface that makes managing availability and scheduling sessions a breeze.
Innovative Visualizations: We’ve taken extra care to ensure that availability and session data are displayed in a clear, visually appealing way. The design is fully responsive, providing a seamless experience across devices—whether you're on a desktop, tablet, or smartphone.
Accessibility: The application is built with accessibility in mind, ensuring that all users can effectively interact with the system.
🛠️ Technology Stack
Frontend: Built using React with Tailwind CSS for fast and responsive design.
Backend: Node.js with Express, handling user data and scheduling logic.
Database: MongoDB for efficient storage and retrieval of availability and session data.
Authentication: Basic email-based login to maintain a simple yet effective record of users.
